Acetonitrile wishes it were methanol, but it ain't. It is one of the most polar non-HBD solvents, and probably the most polar one you will work with on a day-to-day basis. Even so, its inability to donate H-bonds means it can't quite crack the ultra polar club of the short-chain alcohols. This is not a bad thing, however, and acetonitrile is a very useful solvent.

Deuterated acetonitrile is a fairly common NMR solvent. It is cheap enough to use semi-regularly, but since DMSO-d6 and CDCl<sub>3</sub> do such a good job, it's not really needed. I have never really found a situation where it has worked better than those two solvents, probably because insoluble compounds tend to be low-polarity.

The lack of an exchangeable proton is acetonitrile's biggest strength: it is the polar solvent you go to when you don't want anything that can lose a proton to interfere with your reaction. Acetonitrile is mildly basic though, so it could react with a sufficiently strong acid.

Have fun; don't die.\
