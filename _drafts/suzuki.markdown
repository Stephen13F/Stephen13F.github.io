|Suzuki-Miyaura cross couplings my beloved.|

I really like SM cross couplings (which I'll refer to as Suzukis from now on. Full credit to Miyaura, but it's a mouthful to say both names). They are the bread and butter of my synthesis. They make my reactions feel like jigsaw puzzles, and I've loved jigsaws since I was three so it's perfect.

The reaction creates a C-C bond between two sp<sup>2</sup> hybridised carbons by using a halide and a boronic acid. Pseudo halides (e.g. tosylates) can be used instead of the halide. The reaction is catalysed by palladium complexed to ligands and a base. It is a very complex system and there are *many* variations you can make to a reaction when optimising it. I do not intend to go into great depth here because I cannot do this reaction justice: my knowledge is good, but still rather shallow. All I want to do here is ensure people appreciate this reaction and learn to avoid a few common mistakes.

A very popular set of conditions for this reaction is Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> ((tetrakis triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)), a carbonate base (e.g. K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and toluene for the solvent, often using large excess of the boronic acid. This is absolute trash; do not do this. If *anyone* reports this method in a procedure you are following DO NOT DO IT! I said pet, I said love, I said pet, I said please try different conditions because this WILL NOT WORK (or at least not well).

I was taught Suzuki coupling from a master of Suzukis, a man who dedicated his PhD to this reaction: Nicolau Saker Neto. Almost all I know I learned from him. I will outline here some principles that he told me and I hope by learning these you can make better judgements for your own reactions.

There is no one answer for a Suzuki, but there are wrong answers.

<h1>The Mechanism</h1>

Before we start, it is best we appreciate what exactly is going on in the reaction.

<h1>The Ligand</h1>

As I mentioned at the start, the most popular ligand for these reactions is triphenylphosphine. That's great, but we're not in the 70s anymore. New ligands exist and they are *much* better. If I ever use PPh<sub>3</sub>, I have either been replaced by some sort of changeling or alien, or I purposefully want my Suzuki to go poorly. The latter is more likely than you'd think. *But even then*, I would probably use P(*o*-tolyl)<sub>3</sub>.

<h1>The Solvent</h1>

People have reported 'anhydrous' conditions for Suzuki couplings. I laugh. Ha. Very funny.

Please do not try this: the Suzuki reaction needs water. If you dry your solvent before a Suzuki, you are a fool. If you do your Suzuki in pure toluene, you are misguided. The best choice is either a water miscible solvent or a cosolvent or phase transfer agent that helps bring water into the organic phase.

my favourite solvent for Sukukis is THF. It is water miscible so I dissolve my base in water and add it to the 

<h1>Set Up</h1>

The Suzuki reaction is sensitive to oxygen, so all liquids must be sparged with nitrogen befoore use (I usually set the sparging going before I weigh my solids so by the time I'm done with them it's ready). You close a flask of the liquid with a suba seal, stick in a long needle connected to a nitrogen line and a short needle that is just open to air. The long needle goes into the solvent and will bubble nitrogen into the liquid, displacing oxygen. Since oxygen weighs less, it will rise and eventually flow out of the other needle. This should take 15-30 minutes, depending on the volume of solvent. Be careful: volatile solvents like THF will evaporate during this time, so put in a bit more solvent than you expect to use and don't leave it running forever.

When you have weighed the solids and added them to the flask, you can remove the outlet needle. You can keep the nitrogen flowing into the liquids.

A word about the flask: you can use an rbf, but there also exist pear shaped Schlenk flasks which I quite like to use. These have long necks which can act a bit like a condenser if you heat the solvent close to its bp, but be careful. They also have a spout you can connect to a schlenk line. Otherwise, when using an rbf, you just poke needles into the suba seal. When screening Suzukis, I use microwave vials sealed with vial caps. These should not pop off even if the pressure gets very high due to volatile solvents.

Make sure you put your stirrer bar in the flask now.

Once you are ready with the solids, pull the needles out of the liquids, but not out of the flasks. Connect the flask with the solids to the Schlenk line and turn on the high vacuum. Wait about ten minutes then turn the tap to nitrogen. The nitrogen will flow in almost instantly; only the vacuum takes time. I advise you turn the tap *very* slowly to avoid the solids sort of blowing about and getting stuck to the sides of the vessel. You only need to turn slowly close to the ends, when the actual openings line up. If you do get solid stuck to the edges, you can usually wash it down with solvent if you squirt it in strategically. This is your last good chance to put the stirrer bar in if you forgot it because all you need to do is redo the vac/N<sub>2</sub> cycles.

After you have gone from vacuum to nitrogen three times, you are ready to add the liquids. Take a syringe with a needle attached. Keep the plastic sheath on it and stick it in a tube connected to the nitrogen line. turn on the nitrogen and 'rinse' the tube with nitrogen by pulling nitrogen in and pushing out a few times. Pull in a bit and then stick the needle into one of the liquids' flasks. By doing this, you avoid introducing any oxygen via the needle. Suck up more liquid than you need, bend the needle so the syringe is pointing up. Flick the needle to get any bubbles to rise to the top and then push them out. Adjust until you have picked up the correct volume and then lift the needle out of the liquid, but keep it in the nitrogen atmosphere. Pull in some nitrogen and, while keeping the syringe pointing upwards, pull the needle fully out of the flask. Move it to the reaction flask (always pointing up) and then stick it in and push out the liquid. In this way, you have created a cushion of nitrogen that will keep out any air during the transport step. Once you have finished adding the liquids, close their lines and then remove the syringes. Extra base solution can be returned for re-use. Unused solvent is OK to re-use, but the suba seal may have tainted it a bit (it can dissolve and you will see a red stain on the neck of the flask).

It is not the end of the world if you get some oxygen in your Suzuki. Nothing in the mixture should react violently with air. The issue lies in the fact that oxygen can cause some undesired side reactions. I once had a reaction I accidentally set up in an rbf without a condenser and in the morning returned to find the suba seal had popped off. The reaction worked perfectly fine and with good yield, but I did see a few of the expected by-products in the mass spec. It is for this reason that, while I am very careful about air getting in, I am not overly worried if a small amount happens to end up inside the flask.

If you forgot the stirrer bar and have already added your liquids, turn on the nitrogen and point it onto the opening of the flask. If you have a second person to help you, you should get them to hold the nitrogen because you will want two hands free. With one hand hold the stirrer bar and the other will start to open up the suba seal. In one fell motion, take out the suba seal, drop in the stirrer bar and close the suba seal again. Keep the nitrogen blowing onto the flask's opening and it should keep air out OK. I have done this before with no issue.

Have fun; don't forget to add water.\
