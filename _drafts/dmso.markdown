DMSO is an ultra-potent solvent. It is a brilliant solvent. It is middle-to-high polarity and capable of dissolving most things. DMSO, however, has two major flaws: one is that it is *very* hygroscopic and so any bottle of DMSO that has been opened will probably get wet within moments, and the other is that it is *very* hard to evaporate.

Deuterated DMSO is the second most popular NMR solvent (after chloroform-d). Despite it requiring the replacement of 6 protons, it is made on a large enough scale that it is quite economical. <sup>1</sup>H NMRs using DMSO will show large water peaks. You will need to dry the solvent with molecular sieves but even then I would expect a peak unless you prepare the sample in a glovebox. DMSO-d6 will (generally) show exchangeable protons (unlike chloroform-d), but since they will exchange with the water present, they can be quite broad. These NMR samples are also hard to recover. The only way you might be able to do it is if you got the sample to precipitate in water, but even then, that's not guaranteed and I doubt it'd be worth the effort unless you're really desperate.

DMSO has no real role in any typical work up method. You cannot remove it completely (or really at all) by rotary evaporation, so it is not worth using and then struggling to remove later. It is also too good at dissolving most things for recrystallisations. It also freezes at just below room temperature, so you can't even cool it to recrys. The emphasis here is on 'typical' and there are cases where it is used. It would be good if you need to dissolve a really difficult to dissolve compound which you can then precipitate by adding another solvent (e.g. water).

To get rid of DMSO, there are ways. You can precipitate your product out of the DMSO with water and wash with a lot of water, then extract into another solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate) and evaporate off that and perhaps do a lot more washing with water if you can. You will probably still see DMSO impurity peaks in your NMR unless you do this very well. Alternatively, you can add water and freeze dry it. I've never done this before.

DMSO is a good reaction solvent despite the difficulty you'll have removing it. Being rather strongly polar it is capable of dissolving salts to some extent. Since it is very hard to deprotonate, it is a good solvent for use with many strong bases. In fact, I have read that KOH in DMSO is even more basic than when it's in water, but I have found it rather difficult to dissolve it to a substantial degree (perhaps extensive sonication could have solved the issue or if it had been finely ground initially, but pellets of KOH are hard to crush sometimes). DMSO is itself a mild oxidant. It's mild enough that you typically won't see it reacting with your compounds, but it's strong enough that there are a few reactions that actually involve DMSO as a reactant.

DMSO is often drawn as if it has the structure of acetone (i.e. planar), but in reality it is pyramidal since the sulfur has an extra lone pair of electrons that drawings often ignore. Additionally it has a significant resonance form where the electrons from the double bond delocalise into the oxygen. Thus, the (rather positively-charged) sulfur is electrophilic and the (more negative) oxygen is nucleophilic.

I was always told to remove my gloves instantly if I got DMSO on them. I thought this was because DMSO was carcinogenic (because this advice was told for dealing with NMR solvents, i.e. chloroform-d and DMSO-d6 and chloroform is a carcinogen). In fact, DMSO is actually not significantly toxic. It's honestly pretty safe, all things considered. Its real risk is that it is such a strong solvent: if you get a solution of DMSO and another compound, it will carry that compound straight through your gloves and onto (and into) your skin. Remove gloves with DMSO on them, otherwise you might as well not be wearing gloves, especially because it will not evaporate away and will remain lingering on them.

Have fun; don't die.\
