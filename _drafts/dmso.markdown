DMSO is an ultra-potent solvent. It is a brilliant solvent. It is middle polarity and capable of dissolving most things. DMSO has only two major issues: one is that it is *very* hygroscopic and so any bottle of DMSO that has been opened will probably be wet, and the other is that it is *very* hard to evaporate.

Deuterated DMSO is the second most popular NMR solvent (after chloroform-d). Despite it requiring the replacement of 6 protons, it is made on a large enough scale that it is quite economical. <sup>1</sup>H NMRs using DMSO will show large water peaks. You will need to dry the solvent with molecular sieves but even then I would expect a peak unless you prepare the sample in a glovebox. DMSO-d6 will (generally) show exchangeable protons (unlike chloroform-d), but since they will exchange with the water present, they can be quite broad. These NMR samples are also hard to recover. The only way you might be able to do it is if you got the sample to precipitate in water, but even then, that's not guaranteed and I doubt it'd be worth the effort unless you're really desperate.

DMSO has no real role in any typical work up method. You cannot remove it completely (or really at all) by rotary evaporation, so it is not worth using and then struggling to remove later. It is also too good at dissolving most things for recrystallisations. It also freezes at just below room temperature, so you can't even cool it to recrys.

To get rid of DMSO, there are ways. You can precipitate your product out of the DMSO with water and wash with a lot of water, then extract into another solvent (e.g. ethyl acetate) and evaporate off that and perhaps do a lot more washing with water if you can. You will probably still see DMSO impurities in your NMR unless you do this very well. Alternatively, you can add water and freeze dry it. I've never done this before.

DMSO is a good reaction solvent despite the difficulty you'll have removing it.

I was always told to remove my gloves instantly if I got DMSO on them. I thought this was because DMSO was carcinogenic (because this advice was told for dealing with NMR solvents, i.e. chloroform-d and DMSO-d6). In fact, DMSO is actually not significantly toxic. It's honestly pretty safe, all things considered. Its real risk is that it is such a strong solvent: if you get a solution of DMSO and another compound, it will carry that compound straight through your gloves and onto (and probably into) your skin. Remove gloves with DMSO on them, otherwise you might as well not be wearing gloves, especially because it will not evaporate away and will remain lingering on them.

Have fun; don't die.\
