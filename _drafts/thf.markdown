I'm in like an abusive relationship with THF where I love it because it is great for Suzuki couplings but it kills my dyes. I hate this solvent but I cannot live without it.

THF is a cyclic ether. It is what I would call 'low polar' but most people will refer to it as just being polar. It is quite a strong solvent for organic compounds.

I used to use it a lot for chromatography, but I have since heard it is bad because it gives very streaky fractions and poor separation, which may explain why my early chromatographic attempts often failed. It is useful though if you are just using silica to filter off an impurity (e.g. palladium black).

I use it a lot for Suzukis because it is water miscible. It is volatile and thus easy to remove, but unfortunately since it has a low boiling point you cannot heat the reaction up very high. Being water miscible also means you cannot get it to phase separate well with water. It *is* possible to get clear separation if you use brine, but I have done this and you will still have water in your organic layer and you will need a lot (and I mean a lot) of mag sulfate to get it out. I've noticed adding a bit of pet. spirits can also help force water out, but in that case you might be concerned about your product precipitating.

Once I had significant THF peaks in my NMR even after rotavapping and I found that just sticking the product under high vac and blowing the flask with a heat gun got it off after an hour or so.

One of its major hazards is that it can form peroxides. These are bad because they are strong oxidants but also because they are explosive. Coupled with the fact it is already flammable, this is not ideal. To avoid this, BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene, aka 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) is added to THF as an antioxidant. BHT is harder to remove than THF and you may see signals for it in your NMRs too.

THF also kind of stinks. It's got an ethereal scent, but it's not nice and sweet like diethyl ether. It smells more like petrol fumes. Its volatility and ability to dissolve low-polar to non-polar substances makes it very difficult to store in solvent squeeze bottles. In fact, I would probably discourage using a squeeze bottle for it since I find they seem to degrade when holding THF. It will also dissolve your gloves (I learned this the hard way), so please be careful.

Have fun; don't die.\
