The most important thing a chemist can do, and probably the bare minimum for reliable experiments, is have clean glassware. Trace impurities (especially metal catalysts) can impact reactions significantly. It is also good for lab harmony if you keep things clean. Nothing is worse than reaching for an rbf only to find it still slightly dirty and having to wash it all over again because you don't know how clean it is. Actually, the worst thing is when people leave unlabled samples in rbfs for weeks, especially if you're certain it's just garbage to be cleaned away but you don't know what it is and can do nothing.

Please, people, I beg you: clean your glassware!

<h1>Glassware</h1>

I was taught this method by a really pedantic postdoc and I consider it the gold standard. I will teach this to anyone I supervise.

First, rinse out your compound with a solvent you know it dissolves well in. If you have a lot of solid that dissolves poorly then try to scrape it out first to avoid wasting solvent. If you use a chlorinated solvent, rinse that out with an alcohol into the chlorinated waste. I would then rinse with acetone if you haven't already. The glassware should be more or less clean by now. Make sure you have wiped off any pen ink labels with acetone.

Next, add some detergent. Sometimes (I see it with phenol derivatives a lot) you will see colour appearing when the detergent is added and in this case I rinse the soap into the hydrocarbons waste with acetone or alcohol. If it is a vessel (rbf, conical flask, sep funnel etc), fill it with hot, soapy water and scrub with a bottlebrush. If the vessel is very small, use a pipe cleaner. For things with spouts, use a pipe cleaner, but be gentle, especially for sep funnels. Try to get some nice suds going and get all the walls scrubbed. Get some detergent on a sponge and wash the outside. The outside of an rbf can easily get inside, so you want that to be clean too. For other glassware, I would just use a sponge instead of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner unless it has a spout-like thing (e.g. funnels).

Rinse the soap out with tap water. To get suds out of an rbf, you should shake it while it is half full, opening pointing into the sink. Repeat this a few times. For small vessels you can also just fill then up and let them overflow so the subs rise up and out. I'm an Australian and I grew up during the Millenium Drought so I am *very* water-conscious. I try to minimise water usage when cleaning glassware (the thought of leaving the tap running makes me feel faint), but that's just me. Even so (especially if you're an Aussie), you never know when the next drought will strike, so try not to use too much water.

After rinsing your flask clean (and making sure your hands are suds-free), rinse it again with distilled water. This should wash away any ions from the tap water. A quick rinse will suffice.

Finally, wash with acetone once more. This is to remove the water. Dry it with a compressed air gun. The outside you can get away with just drying with a paper towel and not rinsing with acetone (though I would rinse around the lip and neck to be safe). If you still see liquid rivules or droplets after a while blowing it dry, it's probably water, so just give it another quick rinse and start drying again.

Leave your glassware drying on paper towel, openings of rbfs etc facing down so any lingering solvent drips out and doesn't pool inside. Make sure to put them away after they're fully dry.

If something is really stuck on, you can apply some elbow grease: soak a paper towel in acetone (or any appropriate solvent), wrap it around the end of a bent spatula, then stick it in the flask and scrub. If this fails, try sonicating with solvent inside, or using a bottle brush (though you should clean that before using it on any other glassware). Sometimes I'll use detergent and solvent mixed together and scrub, or use soapy water and then pour it into my aqueous waste container. Try to avoid pouring organic compounds with questionable safety down the drain.

<h1>Glass Frits/h1>

This applies to anything with fritted glass. Wash by spraying solvent and running the vacuum to suck it down (or letting it drip through). I advise a mix of solvents of different types, but usually methanol and acetone will get used. For frits which can be attached to a vacuum, add some soapy water and pull that through then rinse with distilled water followed by acetone. Make sure you empty the flask collecting the washes before and after you use water (do not pour water into your organic waste). A good solvent to end on is petroleum spirits because it will easily evaporate (glass frits are a pain to dry with an air gun): just leave it under vacuum for a while and it should be dry.

<h1>NMR Tubes and caps</h1>

You can buy glass NMR tube cleaners. They're a thin glass tube surrounded by a larger tube and a sort of solvent reservoir. you connect it to a vacuum, stick the NMR tube onto the thin tube, add the solvent and move the NMR tube up and down so it sucks and releases the solvent which will get taken into the inner tubeand down into an rbf.

Alternatively you can make your own with a cannula, a couple of adapters and a vessel to catch the solvent. You stick the tube onto the cannula, spray solvent at the base and the rest is like how I described before.

Alternatively you just spray solvent in with a pipette or a squeeeze bottle, just be careful when using a squeeze bottle not to push the tip in too hard (is it just me, or is this section getting a bit suggestive?) or the tube will chip and become useless.

I advise rinsing with the NMR solvent first. I would then rinse with methanol if I had used chloroform. Make sure to rinse out the reservoir between chlorinated and acetone washes. A final acetone rinse should do the trick, but if it's still got stuff on it then try other solvents. You could probably sonicate it if it's really bad. I've never done that before, but I think it'll be fine, just clean the tube with water, acetone and kimwipe it so nothing from the sonicator bath sticks to it.

Once the tube is clean, place it in an oven to dry. It can take a while for acetone to fully evaporate, so spectra done with very freshly cleaned tubes may show residual acetone.

For NMR caps, I usually let them sit a bit in a beaker of solvent (probably acetone) and then let them dry off or blow them with an air gun. Unless you're inverting your tubes, they should'nt be very dirty, and you might even be able to get away with not cleaning them (though if you're sharing them, you really should clean them).

<h1>Spatulas and Tweezers</h1>

I have said before that elbow grease is the best solvent. This is where it is most true. Rinse spatulas with acetone and while they're still wet scrub with a paper towel to get them clean. You physically pulling off the compound will be very effective. Use a different solvent if acetone doesn't work (but be safe since it'll get on your fingers). If something is still staining it then you can give it a full wash with a sponge.

<h1>Stirrer Bars</h1>

Acetone scrub will usually do, or a good wash with a sponge if it's bad, but sometimes metal catalyst will stick or the stirrer bars will get stained. In this case, a soak in acid overnight or for a few days will do the trick. Be careful with acids. Please use normal acid before you try anything crazy like aqua regia (or worse). Also please put up a notice warning people you're using acid. If you see a bunch of stirrer bars in a beaker full of an unknown liquid, DO NOT TOUCH.

<h1>Glass or Quartz Slides</h1>

Place your cut slides into a beaker of solvent and sonicate while moving them around a bit to ensure they're all well coated in solvent. Chloroform should do the job, just don't breath the vapours. Use a mix of solvents to be safe. After washing, wipe them clean with a kimwipe coated with a solvent (acetone, iso-propanol etc), then dry by blowing on them with nitrogen. Store them in a safe place, covered to keep out dust.

Alternatively, there's a plasma cleaner thing.

<h1>Cuvettes</h1>

Pour out the solution, rinse with the solvent used then acetone (or if chlorinated solvents were used, rinse with alcohol into the chlorinated waste, then use acetone). Rinse the sides clean with acetone and wipe them clean with a kimwipe. While using a kimwipe to hold the cuvette securely, blow compressed air in to dry it. If you touch the glass at all, wipe it down with a kimwipe with a bit of acetone then dry it down with a dry kimwipe.

<h1>Glass Stoppers and Adapters</h1>

A wipe with acetone will usually suffice, but if product has actually touched it then I would give it the full wash (soap, water etc).

<h1>Glass Pipettes</h1>

Rinse out with acetone and blow dry with compressed air. This is best for pipettes that have only touched solvents (if you used chloroform, rinse it out into the waste with a non-acetone solvent like an alcohol before using acetone). You can clean pipettes that have been used for other things but don't waste too muuch time or solvent. You should rinse with either acetone or a known solvent that dissolves your compound well followed by acetone (or methanol then acetone if the solvent is chlorinated).

<h1>Columns and Plugs</h1>

Silica can often be reused if you have fully washed out everything, there's nothing stuck on the baseline at the top and there's nothing stuck to the frit at the bottom. You may need to recompact it, but that's not too big a deal.

If you empty the silica out and want to clean it (especially if the silica still had compound on it), I advise an acetone rinse (or a different solvent first if you used a chlorinated solvent): pour some in, make sure the sides got coated, then push it out with N<sub>2</sub>. After this, wash out the residual silica with water into the sink. Rinse again with acetone and again push it out with N<sub>2</sub>. This should suffice. I wouldn't scrub with soap etc because colums are just too long; you can't get a brush down far enough to wash it properly. If some residue were stuck, and it didn't come out with solvent, then I highly doubt it will cause you issues during a column (though it's not impossible).

See the instructions for frits above if you have stuff stuck to the frit. This is probably the real problem area and I would focus my efforts on cleaning this part.

<h1>Benchtops</h1>

Benchtops should be coated with that cover thingy. I like to do two layers and have the shiny sides facing out (like a sandwich). If they get dirty or torn you should replace them. To make this less arduous, lay the paper across the bench in segments held together with masking tape, so if one part is bad you only have to replace that section.

<h1>Schlenck Lines</h1>

This is my least favourite cleaning job. It is, as my uncle would say, quite a process. Be very careful with schlenck lines at all times: they are very fragile and one crack can ruin the whole line.

Remove the line (carefully) by first detaching the nitrogen and vacuum, then (slowly, while holding the line at all times) open the clamps holding it up. Lay it on the bench and (BE VERY CAREFUL) cut open the tubes attached to the taps etc.

Have fun; keep clean.\
