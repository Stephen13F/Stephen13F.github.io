I am warning you now: do not use benzene.

This is one of the most toxic solvents you will find in the lab.

Anything you want to use it for, you should use toluene instead. Just stop. PUT DOWN THE BOTTLE OF BENZENE NOW and put it back in the flammables cabinet where it belongs.

There are a few rare cases where you would use it. The main one is deuterobenzene (benzene-d6) for NMR. Toluene is not made as an NMR solvent and is not really useful due to having four hydrogen environments. Benzene, being symmetrical, only has one. It should only be used if you are absolutely desperate and have exhausted all other alternatives.

Do not use it for work-ups. EVER. It is not worth the risk.

I wouldn't use it for a reaction since it is no better than toluene and has a lower BP to boot. You *could* use it as a solvent that also acts as a reagent (e.g. for electrophillic aromatic substitution or CMD), but just buy the desired derivative instead of exposing yourself to benzene; you would be paying for the savings with your life.

Don't use benzene; don't die.\
Stephen
