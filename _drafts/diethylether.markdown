This guy is, like, woah man. Real trippy. I always get a little loopy after spending too long with diethyl ether. This makes sense because it was historically used as an anaesthetic. It was also used historically (and, I expect, still is used) as a recreational drug. Your personal recreation is your own business, but do not huff ether in the lab. It's not so much the ether as it is that you'll probably kill yourself by doing something stupid while high. Labs are for making drugs, not using them.

Diethyl ether is a solvent that I would call non-polar. You could call it polar because of the oxygen, but it's right on the border and I already think anything below pyridine is low-polar so diethyl ether is way below that already. It's the last stop before Hydrocarbonville. It is a lot like petroleum spirits (hence why pet. spirits gets called petroleum ether) and I would recommend it be used in much the same way. The only difference is that it is more polar and that oxygen gives it some special properties.

While it does boil very easily (it will evaporate at room temperature), and so cannot be heated much for reactions, it is a strong Lewis acid on account of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen. This makes it a good choice for dissolving Grignard reagents since it forms complexes with the magnesium.

Its volatility and low polarity makes it handy for work-ups. It is immiscible with water and is thus a good choice for a sep funnel if you want something more volatile than EtOAc but less toxic than DCM or chloroform. It is, however, less polar than all three of those, so it may not draw your product out well if it is particularly polar.

It also is immiscible with DMSO. This is rarely useful, but it once happened to me that I had tried to precipitate some dye dissolved in DMSO with ether, but ultimately just separated it out (only partially though, I think most was still in the DMSO). I never used this as an extraction method because my dyes don't survive in diethyl ether (in this case, I got it to crash out by washing with base in water, so it didn't breakdown, but I didn't want to risk it in future). Nicolau claims pure DMSO and diethyl ether should be miscible and that I got separation because it had ions/salts in it, but solvent miscibility charts say otherwise.

It is more miscible than petroleum spirits in every other ommon solvent, which makes it easier to add to solutions to precipitate out product. On the other hand, it may not be non-polar enough to trigger precipitation, but it probably will work.

Given its volatility, diethyl ether is difficult to store well in a squeeze bottle (it's a common sight to find bottles just spray out on their own after a mild jostling, or even completely unprompted, especially in hot weather). Just open up and close the bottle again to release the build up of pressure. The spilled ether will evaporate in seconds, just try not to breath it in and keep heat sources away from it.

Ether is more of a work-up solvent than anything else. If you just think of it as the (slightly) polar version of petroleum spirits, then you can probably understand how to use it.

Have fun; don't die.\
