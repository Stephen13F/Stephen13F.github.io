Ah, chloroform. I dislike chloroform and will go out of my way to avoid using it. I also have a personal vendetta against it because of my dyes degrading in it, so I may be a little biased against it.

It is a middle polarity solvent and is very strong at dissolving middle to low polarity organic compounds. This is part of why deuterated chloroform is such a popular solvent for NMR. It is also well-used because it is easy to make since you only need to replace one proton with deuterium and because it has only one hydrogen environment and one carbon environment. It also evaporates *very* easily: NMR samples taken in CDCl<sub>3</sub> can be recovered by pouring the sample into a vial and blowing into the vial with nitrogen from the Schlenk line (using a needle helps, as does holding the tube and vial in place with clamps). CDCl<sub>3</sub> has some issues, however, the main one being that it (and obviously regular chloroform) is mildly acidic, forming DCl (HCl for regular CHCl<sub>3</sub>). This can replace exchangeable protons and thus render them invisible in <sup>1</sup>H NMR. There are two ways around this: one is to remove the acid by running your CDCl<sub>3</sub> through basic alumina, the other is to buy CDCl<sub>3</sub> with a piece of silver foil inside which prevents the formation of the acid. Chloroform-d is thus not always a great solvent if you are trying to determine the presence or absence of an NH<sub>2</sub> or OH group. It is also not a great choice for some aromatic compounds since the solvent residual peak occurs very close to the aromatic hydrogen region, and although this peak is quite easy to distinguish it can overlap with your compound's signals. Chloroform does not get wet as easily as most NMR solvents, but it still can, so make sure to keep it well sealed (also so that it does not evaporate away).

It is a good work-up solvent. It is immiscible with water, making it good for using in a sep funnel, and is a good chromatography solvent, though I feel its brother DCM gets more use. I wouldn't use it for recrystallisations much since it is hard to heat up, but it could work if you let the solvent evaporate off slowly until crystals start to form (Ã  la pet. spirits). Chloroform is very easily removed by rotary evaporation and any residual solvent (if there is any) should be gone after you put the sample under high vacuum.

Chloroform is not an unusual reaction solvent, since it does dissolve a lot of organic compounds very well, but considering its low boiling point, it is not the greatest. A low or room temperature reaction would be fine though. As mentioned prior, it can be acidic, but even worse chloroform can form carbenes in the presence of strong bases (carbenes are highly reactive and I would not count on your product surviving them unscathed). It is also worth pointing out that salts will not dissolve in it, so some sort of phase transfer agent would probably be needed if you were trying to use a salt mixed in water. Very polar organic compounds will also probably not dissolve very well.

Chloroform used to be used as an anaesthetic (you see people use it on TV, but it does not work anywhere near as fast as it is shown to) and so can cause drowsiness. Drowsiness is the least of your worries though. The main reason I avoid chloroform is that it is toxic and carcinogenic. It can go through gloves, so please be very safe and remove chloroform-coated gloves as soon as humanely possible. Due to its volatility, it is important you handle it inside the fumehood or with an extractor above you. Chloroform is also related to the chlorofluorocarbons that cause damage to the ozone layer, and so it is not wise to allow too much of it to escape into the air. Chloroform goes into the chlorinated waste since it cannot be disposed of in the same way as hydrocarbon waste; please rinse out chloroform-containing vessels with non-chlorinated solvents (but not acetone) into the chlorinated waste before rinsing with acetone into the hydrocarbon waste.

I advise you avoid chloroform if you can, for the health of both yourself and the environment, but it has its place and it is a necessary evil. It is also such a handy NMR solvent.

Have fun; don't die.\
Stephen
