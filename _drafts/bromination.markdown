Adding a halide to a compound is very handy, particularly since halogenated compounds are used in many copuling reactions.

The process for halogenation is essentially the same for chlorine, bromine and iodine, but not fluorine. I have never done a fluorination and so I will not cover that here.

<h1>Halogen Source</h1>

The most obvious source of a halogen is its elemental form. I pretty much never use these because they are a pain. Bromine is a liquid, and so is iodine, but they tend to drip when you try picking them up with a pipette and bromine can also be a pain to store for prolonged periods. Chlorine is a gas, and a very unpleasant one at that. While you can measure the density of bromine and iodine to calculate the moles you're using, it's a bit more annoying to work with a gas (you'd need to use the ideal gas law or something).

In a nutshell, elemental halogens are the teenagers of the periodic table: they're messy and awkward. So what can we use instead?

My favourite bromine source is N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Equivalents exist for chlorine and iodine (N-chlorosuccinimide aka NCS and N-iodosuccinimide aka NIS). These are solids which you can easily weigh and add to the solution. It also makes it easier to control the speed of addition.

You can also use them to generate elemental halogen in solution: HCl and NCS will react to form chlorine gas.
