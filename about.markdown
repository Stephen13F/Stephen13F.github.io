I'm Stephen Franzese, a masters student studying chemistry at Melbourne Uni. This is a collection of my tips and techniques, mostly focused on organic synthetic chemistry.

I made this blog to record what I have learned over the years. I hope you gain something useful in your time here.

<h1>My Research</h1>
I am a member of the Wong Group which is a part of the Australian Centre of Excellence in [Exciton Science](https://excitonscience.com/users/stephen-franzese). My research focuses on solvatochromic dyes: both synthesising them and analysing their properties.
