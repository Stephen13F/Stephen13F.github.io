I used to think toluol was an alternative name for phenol, or, I dunno, *P*-methylphenol or something. But it's actually toluene. The more you know. I think toluene smells warm. It's an oddly alluring yet unsettling smell and given toluene's hazards, it's not something I (or you) want to be smelling.

It is a non-polar solvent (apparently it's less polar than the more symmetrical benzene), but it's aromatic ring gives it more solubilising power than one might expect of a compound containing nothing but hydrogen and carbon. It is actually quite a strong solvent, but I probably think this because we work with so many aromatic compounds and I expect phenyl rings interact well with it (*similia similibus solventur* and all that jazz). It is probably the last (sensible and safe) resort for you if your compound is brick dust.

In our old lab we used to go through litres of the stuff every week for chromatography since it is such a good solvent for columns. I personally don't use it much, if ever, but that's largely just out of health and safety concerns. Despite its high boiling point (higher than water's), toluene has a vapour pressure low enough that it can be removed by rotary evaporation. When testing out toluene by TLC, be aware that it will absorb UV light since it contains an aromatic ring. You must dry your TLC plate completely, otherwise your plate will be entirely dark.

Toluene is a decent reaction solvent, capable of reaching quite high temperatures. Its only major fault lies in its inability to dissolve salts and very polar substances. As it is water immiscible, you will need a phase transfer agent or cosolvent to get salts to mix well. It is relatively unreactive (I mean, it can undergo electrophillic aromatic substitution like any benzene derivative, and the methyl group is ring activating, but it is pretty stable otherwise).

Toluene is less toxic than benzene. This is a bit like saying manslaughter is a lesser crime than murder: it is still toxic. It's not known to be carcinogenic though, so there's that. It probably won't kill you, but don't tempt fate. It is also flammable, so usual fire precautions should be in place.

Have fun; don't die.\
