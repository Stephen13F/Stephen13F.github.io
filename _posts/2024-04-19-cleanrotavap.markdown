Rotavaps are possibly one of the most essential pieces of equipment in a lab and are often in high demand, especially if you have to share with others. Imagine trying to do a column without a rotavap; it'd be madness. The worst thing (I know I said the worst thing was when people leave unlabeled flasks with samples in them, but this is an offshoot of that) is when you go to use the rotavap and see someone has left solvent in the trap and you don't know what it is or if it's chlorinated waste or not. I mean, you can sniff it to check, but I like to minimise my exposure to chloroform. To avoid these sorts of issues, this is my guide to sharing a rotavap.

<h1>The Water Bath</h1>

The water bath of a rotavap is a disgusting thing even at the best of times as it will tend to collect dust and dirt. Samples that fall in should be collected and extracted with a sep funnel if possible. This is less to salvage your yield (because you really should purify it again if it falls in, I mean, I would probably just start afresh honestly) than it is about not leaving chemicals sitting about, especially volatile solvents.

The other major problem with the water bath is it being left on overnight. Always make sure to turn it off at the end of the day. It heats up pretty quickly, so you can even turn it off every time you finish with it and it is unlikely to cause other people much grief to restart it. Leaving it on is not only a waste of energy, but eventually the water will all evaporate and the rotavap will continue trying to heat up. I imagine this is not good for the rotavap. An evaporated rotavap is a good excuse to give it a bit of a scrub, but don't expect to get it very clean.

If you see the water level is running low, top it up with tap water. Hot water is good to reduce waiting time for it to return to temperature.

The temperature of the bath is generally kept at 40-50 <sup>o</sup>C. To avoid surprises for the next person, please return the temperature to within this range after use. This also makes sure the water doesn't evaporate away too easily.

<h1>Pressure</h1>

The rotavap has a set temperature which it will go to whenever you press 'start' on the controller. By pressing the down arrow you can decrease the pressure manually and at your desired pace. If you press 'continuous', the rotavap will go to 0 mbar as fast as it can (if it can, otherwise the vacuum will simply keep pumping). If you press 'manual' after using continuous, you can return to changing the pressure yourself, but the set pressure will become whatever it was the moment you pressed stop. This can cause problems if you forget to return it to a higher pressure before pressing start the next time. This does not happen if you simply press 'stop' after using continuous. Please ensure the vacuum pressure is somewhere between 700-800 mbar after you have finished with it. The rotavap also has a hysteresis: you can decide this and it determines what pressure range will cause it to turn on the pump. If the hysteresis is 2, then it will turn on 2 mbar above the set pressure and turn off 2 mbar below it. I do not think you ever need to change what it is preset as (I think it is 2).

The rotavap will struggle to go down to very low pressures if you have a volatile solvent in the flask. If the rotavap is struggling to go down beyond a certain pressure, you will just have to be satisfied with that. The pump can get very loud if you force it down to a pressure it cannot maintain, so for the sake of everyone's ears, try to keep it at a reasonable pressure.

If the pressure fails to go below atmospheric pressure, there is most likely an issue with the connections or the rubber seal. Tighten the connections and clean out the wolf bottle while your at it. The rubber seal is kept where the condenser attaches to the arm where the bump guard connects. This little round ring will need to be replaced over time as it loses its flexibility. You can make do by tying a rubber band around it several times, but it is best you buy a new one eventually.

<h1>The Solvent Trap and Bump Guard</h1>

Always clean out the solvent trap and bump guard after you have used the rotavap. The trap can be cleaned by pouring the solvent into the appropriate waste, rinsing out with an alcohol into the chlorinated waste if you used a chlorinated solvent, and then rinsing with acetone and blowing with an air gun to dry. The bump guard can be rinsed much the same way, but it is wise to give the joint a clean where it touched the flask: rinse with acetone and wipe with a paper towel. If compound has been sucked into the bump guard (or, even worse, the solvent trap), you should clean both the same way as any other piece of glassware. Empty out the collected solvent regularly. By removing the solvent you encourage more to evaporate off. Continuous will not be of much use unless the rotavap is bone dry.

If a significant amount of compound has been sucked into the rotavap, you can clean it by filling an rbf with solvent (probably acetone) and holding it to the joint that the bump guard connects to. Turn on the rotavap, stick the flask onto the joint and pull it off. This will cause it to be sucked in and rinse out the compound into the trap. Repeat this as much as needed.

The clasp that holds the solvent trap in place does not actually need to be tightened. The vacuum is not as good as you might think, even at the best of times, so the little clasp is not going to make it noticeably better. It will also not fall, even if the trap is quite full of solvent.

If the bumpguard is stuck and you can't pull it off, it probably has solvent in the joint and you should just heat it with a heat gun for a while to get it to evaporate.

<h1>Bumping</h1>

When a solution evaporates too quickly, it will start to bubble violently. This is called 'bumping'. The bump guard is there to ensure if anything does bump, you can catch it and return it to the flask without it contaminating the rest of the rotavap (wow, who'd've guessed?).

To avoid bumping, make sure you decrease the pressure *slowly*, especially as you approach the vacuum pressure of the solvent. Be very cautious if you go below that pressure and keep an eye on the flask: one mbar is enough to set things off sometimes. Bumping is reduced by increasing the rotation speed and if you see bumping, decrease the pressure immediately (even a few mbar will do) and increase the rotation speed (within reason, don't go to max if your flask is very full). It is wise to ensure you start spinning at a high pressure (700-800 mbar) before decreasing the pressure further. High temperatures will also cause bumping, but usually only in combination with low pressure. Obviously, if you increase the temperature and it starts to boil, lower the bath temperature, but also lower the vacuum because the water temperature will take a while to decrease.

Always lower the pressure before you stop spinning to prevent bumping. Bumping can also lead to specks of compound flying about, so even if the solvent is almost fully gone you should be very careful about reducing the pressure too much and too fast.

Do not leave a rotavap unattended. This usually ends badly. If you must go, please ensure you are using very mild conditions. A rotavap can only work so fast, so please do not force it to go faster and faster because down that path lies bumping.

<h1>Attaching and Removing Flasks</h1>

Flasks will often float due to buoyancy, but this is not a given, especially in the case of dense solvents and very full flasks. Even with a keck clip, a flask can fall into the water so please hold it in place until the vacuum has been turned on.

When removing the flask, decrease the pressure before stopping spinning. Hold your hand below the neck to catch it in case it falls as the pressure decreases. Remove it only when the pressure has reached 900 mbar or above, especially if you still have liquid inside: trying to pull it out sooner will cause the liquid to shoot up into the bump guard.

Have fun and empty the solvent trap!
