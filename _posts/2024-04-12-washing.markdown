The most important thing a chemist can do, and probably the bare minimum for reliable experiments, is have clean glassware. Trace impurities (especially metal catalysts) can impact reactions significantly. It is also good for lab harmony if you keep things clean. Nothing is worse than reaching for an rbf only to find it still slightly dirty and having to wash it all over again because you don't know how clean it is. Actually, the worst thing is when people leave unlabled samples in rbfs for weeks, especially if you're certain it's just garbage to be cleaned away but you don't know what it is and can do nothing.

Please, people, I beg you: clean your glassware!

<h1>Glassware</h1>

I was taught this method by a postdoc who was really pedantic (in a good way) and I consider it the gold standard. I will teach this to anyone I supervise.

First, rinse out your compound with a solvent you know it dissolves well in. If you have a lot of solid that dissolves poorly then try to scrape it out first to avoid wasting solvent. If you use a chlorinated solvent, rinse that out with an alcohol into the chlorinated waste. I would then rinse with acetone if you haven't already. The glassware should have few, if any, visible compound remaining now. Make sure you have wiped off any pen ink labels with acetone.

Next, add some detergent. Sometimes (I see it with phenol derivatives a lot) you will see colour appearing when the detergent is added and in this case I rinse the soap into the hydrocarbons waste with acetone or alcohol. If it is a vessel (rbf, conical flask, sep funnel etc), fill it with hot, soapy water and scrub with a bottlebrush. If the vessel is very small, use a pipe cleaner. For things with spouts, use a pipe cleaner, but be gentle, especially for sep funnels. Try to get some nice suds going and get all the walls scrubbed. Get some detergent on a sponge and wash the outside. The outside of an rbf can easily get inside, so you want that to be clean too. For other glassware, I would just use a sponge instead of a bottlebrush or pipe cleaner unless it has a spout-like thing (e.g. funnels).

Rinse the soap out with tap water. To get suds out of an rbf, you should shake it while it is half full, opening pointing into the sink. Repeat this a few times. For small vessels you can also just fill then up and let them overflow so the subs rise up and out. I'm an Australian and I grew up during the Millenium Drought so I am *very* water-conscious. I try to minimise water usage when cleaning glassware (the thought of leaving the tap running makes me feel faint), but that's just me. Even so (especially if you're an Aussie), you never know when the next drought will strike, so try not to use too much water.

After rinsing your flask clean (and making sure your hands are suds-free), rinse it again with distilled water. This should wash away any ions from the tap water. A quick rinse will suffice.

Finally, wash with acetone once more. This is to remove the water. Dry it with a compressed air gun. The outside you can get away with just drying with a paper towel and not rinsing with acetone (though I would rinse around the lip and neck to be safe). If you still see liquid rivules or droplets after a while blowing it dry, it's probably water, so just give it another quick rinse and start drying again. Make sure you hold the glassware carefully and avoid inserting the nozzle of the air gun into the spouts of funnels etc. I have broken at least two glass funnels when drying because they have slipped out of my hands. It is a good idea to dry your gloves or replace them entirely before drying (both to avoid getting water back onto the glass. but also so they're less slippery).

Leave your glassware drying on paper towel, openings of rbfs etc facing down so any lingering solvent drips out and doesn't pool inside. Make sure to put them away after they're fully dry.

If something is really stuck on, you can apply some elbow grease: soak a paper towel in acetone (or any appropriate solvent), wrap it around the end of a bent spatula, then stick it in the flask and scrub. If this fails, try sonicating with solvent inside, or using a bottle brush (though you should clean that before using it on any other glassware). Sometimes I'll use detergent and solvent mixed together and scrub, or use soapy water and then pour it into my aqueous waste container. Try to avoid pouring organic compounds with questionable safety down the drain.

<h1>Glass Frits</h1>

This applies to anything with fritted glass. Wash by spraying solvent and running the vacuum to suck it down (or letting it drip through). I advise a mix of solvents of different types, but usually methanol and acetone will get used. For frits which can be attached to a vacuum, add some soapy water and pull that through then rinse with distilled water followed by acetone. Make sure you empty the flask collecting the washes before and after you use water (do not pour water into your organic waste). A good solvent to end on is petroleum spirits because it will easily evaporate (glass frits are a pain to dry with an air gun): just leave it under vacuum for a while and it should be dry.

A stained frit can be cleaned by pouring some acid into it and holding the frit above a beaker overnight. The acid will slowly drip through the frit into the beaker, leaving it clean. Please use normal acid (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) before you try anything crazy like aqua regia (or worse, pirahna solution). Also please put up a notice warning people you're using acid. Acids are dangerous.

<h1>NMR Tubes and caps</h1>

You can buy glass NMR tube cleaners. They're a thin glass tube surrounded by a larger tube and a sort of solvent reservoir. you connect it to a vacuum, stick the NMR tube onto the thin tube, add the solvent and move the NMR tube up and down so it sucks and releases the solvent which will get taken into the inner tube and down into an rbf.

Alternatively you can make your own with a cannula, a couple of adapters and a vessel to catch the solvent. You stick the tube onto the cannula, spray solvent at the base and the rest is like how I described before.

Alternatively you just spray solvent in with a pipette or a squeeeze bottle, just be careful when using a squeeze bottle not to push the tip in too hard (is it just me, or is this section getting a bit suggestive?) or the tube will chip and become useless.

I advise rinsing with the (non-deuterated) NMR solvent first. I would then rinse with methanol if I had used chloroform. Make sure to rinse out the reservoir between chlorinated and acetone washes. A final acetone rinse should do the trick, but if it's still got stuff on it then try other solvents. You could probably sonicate it if it's really bad. I've never done that before, but I think it'll be fine, just clean the tube with water, acetone and kimwipe it so nothing from the sonicator bath sticks to it.

Once the tube is clean, place it in an oven to dry. It can take a while for acetone to fully evaporate, so spectra done with very freshly cleaned tubes may show residual acetone.

For NMR caps, I usually let them sit a bit in a beaker of solvent (probably acetone) and then let them dry off or blow them with an air gun. Unless you're inverting your tubes, they should'nt be very dirty, and you might even be able to get away with not cleaning them (though if you're sharing them, you really should clean them).

<h1>Spatulas and Tweezers</h1>

I have said before that elbow grease is the best solvent. This is where it is most true. Rinse spatulas with acetone and while they're still wet scrub with a paper towel to get them clean. You physically pulling off the compound will be very effective. Use a different solvent if acetone doesn't work (but be safe since it'll get on your fingers). If something is still staining it then you can give it a full wash with a sponge.

<h1>Stirrer Bars</h1>

An acetone scrub will usually do, or a good wash with a sponge if it's bad, but sometimes metal catalyst will stick or the stirrer bars will get stained. In this case, a soak in acid overnight or for a few days will do the trick. Be careful with acids. Please use normal acid before you try anything crazy like aqua regia (or worse). Also please put up a notice warning people you're using acid. If you see a bunch of stirrer bars in a beaker full of an unknown liquid, DO NOT TOUCH.

<h1>Glass or Quartz Slides</h1>

Place your cut slides into a beaker of solvent and sonicate while moving them around a bit to ensure they're all well coated in solvent. Chloroform should do the job, just don't breath the vapours. Use a mix of solvents to be safe. After washing, wipe them clean with a kimwipe coated with a solvent (acetone, iso-propanol etc), then dry by blowing on them with nitrogen. Store them in a safe place, covered to keep out dust.

Alternatively, there's a plasma cleaner thing.

<h1>Cuvettes</h1>

Pour out the solution, rinse with the solvent used then acetone (or if chlorinated solvents were used, rinse with alcohol into the chlorinated waste, then use acetone). Rinse the sides clean with acetone and wipe them clean with a kimwipe. While using a kimwipe to hold the cuvette securely, blow compressed air in to dry it. If you touch the glass at all, wipe it down with a kimwipe with a bit of acetone then dry it down with a dry kimwipe.

<h1>Stoppers and Adapters</h1>

A wipe with acetone will usually suffice, but if product has actually touched it then I would give it the full wash (soap, water etc).

<h1>Rubber Seals</h1>

I avoid using acetone often unless I really dirtied them. I think it might be bad for the rubber. I usually clean with iso-propanol and a good scrub with a paper towel.

<h1>Glass Pipettes</h1>

Rinse out with acetone and blow dry with compressed air. This is best for pipettes that have only touched solvents (if you used chloroform, rinse it out into the waste with a non-acetone solvent like an alcohol before using acetone). You can clean pipettes that have been used for other things but don't waste too muuch time or solvent. You should rinse with either acetone or a known solvent that dissolves your compound well followed by acetone (or methanol then acetone if the solvent is chlorinated).

<h1>Columns and Plugs</h1>

Silica can often be reused if you have fully washed out everything, there's nothing stuck on the baseline at the top and there's nothing stuck to the frit at the bottom. You may need to recompact it, but that's not too big a deal.

If you empty the silica out and want to clean the column (especially if the silica still had compound on it), I advise an acetone rinse (or a different solvent first if you used a chlorinated solvent): close the stopcock, pour some in, make sure the sides got coated, then open the stopcock and let the solvent flow out into a beaker or flask. If need be, you can push it out with N<sub>2</sub>. After this, wash out the residual silica with water into the sink. Rinse again with acetone and again let the solvent out throught the stopcock. This should suffice. I wouldn't scrub with soap etc because colums are just too long: you can't get a brush down far enough to wash it properly. If some residue were stuck, and it didn't come out with solvent, then I highly doubt it will cause you issues during a column (though it's not impossible). You can always try to scrub with a brush; it won't hurt.

See the instructions for frits above if you have stuff stuck to the frit. This is probably the real problem area and I would focus my efforts on cleaning this part.

<h1>Oil Baths</h1>

If you have put anything into an oil bath, let it drip into the bath after taking it out. Once it is cool, wipe it clean with a paper towel and petroleum spirits/hexane. Wipe your hot plate clean after removing the oil bath. Change gloves after touching the oil bath to avoid oil getting on other stuff. If your oil looks dirty, throw it away into the silicone oil waste (NOT hydrocarbons) and then, after wiping the bath clean with pet. spirits, add fresh oil. Please don't persist with brown looking oil baths. Oil baths are painful enough without also being disgusting.

<h1>Benchtops</h1>

Benchtops should be coated with that cover thingy. I like to do two layers and have the shiny sides facing out (like a sandwich). If they get dirty or torn you should replace them. To make this less arduous, lay the paper across the bench in segments held together with masking tape, so if one part is bad you only have to replace that section.

<h1>Schlenk Lines</h1>

This is my least favourite cleaning job. It is, as my uncle would say, quite a process. Be very careful with schlenk lines at all times: they are very fragile and one crack can ruin the whole line.

Remove the line (carefully) by first detaching the nitrogen and vacuum, then (slowly, while holding the line at all times) open the clamps holding it up. Lay it on the bench and (BE VERY CAREFUL) cut open the tubes attached to the taps etc.

Then try your hardest to rinse out the line with a mix of solvents, using a pipe cleaner to scrub away any solid stuff. Remove the taps and clean them out with a pipecleaner too.

An alternative method can be found [here](https://schlenklinesurvivalguide.com/cleaning-2/).

Grease should be easily removed by petroleum spirits/hexane. Toluene is a good solvent for cleaning the line but it is quite toxic so be careful.

Consider what you have gotten stuck in the line. If you know what's in it, then you should hopefully know what will dissolve it. If you have sucked up silica (I have seen this once. Not the actual sucking up, but I've seen the silica stuck in the line), then after pouring it into the silica waste you should rinse with water.

Schlenk lines should be ballasted fairly fequently, especially if solvent has been sucked into the line. You only need to do it for about 15-30 minutes, maybe once a month minimum. There should be a sort of dial-like switch which you turn to the other direction. You cannot use your vacuum while this is occurring, so please make sure people are not using the vacuum before you do this and let people know you're doing it.

<h1>Fumehoods</h1>

A fumehood should be cleaned at least yearly (I am not a hypocrite: I have actually cleaned mine yearly, even if only because we had a lab-wide clean and then a year later we moved labs). Remove everything and then spray some solvent and scrub. Perhaps get a sponge (which you will need to throw away) for this. After this, rinse it all down (your fumehood should have taps for cooling water, so attach a tube and use it as a hose). Try to get rid of any dust (I found spraying water or compressed air at it worked alright). A scrub with soap followed by another rinse with water would also be nice. Clean the glass of the sash from the inside and out. A fumehood you can actually see into is the bare minimum.

A year is long, however, so please keep your fumehood clean by wiping up spills when they happen and not leaving random samples sitting around (OK, I admit I once had about 20 or 30 glass vials of dye dissolved in different solvents sitting in my fumehood, but in my defence I was interested in potential degradation and wanted to be able to check them again if need be).

<h1></h1>
I have seen many horrors in my time in the lab. Cleaning is important and you need to put the effort in. A clean lab is a lab that makes you feel happy. It makes you more efficient and if everyone is pulling their weight your team will not be fantasising about throwing your samples into the waste because they have been clogging up their workspace for three weeks.

Put things back where you found them. Label things properly. Be careful so you avoid making messes in the first place.

If you are dead tired and it is the end of the day and the idea of washing up makes you want to drink straight from the ethanol squeeze bottle (or whichever solvent you prefer*), then it is OK to leave your glassware, but please rinse it clean first with acetone, even just a quick rinse. Then wash it up properly first thing in the morning.

Have fun; keep clean.\
