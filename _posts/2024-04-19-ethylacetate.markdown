I think ethyl acetate smells like hazelnuts. Other people say it smells like nail polish. I kind of like the smell, in small doses. It makes me a little hungry, which isn't helped by the fact it supposedly tastes sweet. In the lab, it's a well rounded solvent that can be used for most applications. I went through a bit of an ethyl acetate phase for a while because it is so handy (and not just because I liked the smell).

It is a fairly low polarity solvent and so it is not particularly great at dissolving everything, but it is still quite capable and its BP is not too low either, which combined makes it a decent solvent for recrys. It would probably be quite good to add pet. spirits to it to precipitate a polar product. It is not miscible with water and is thus a great choice for liquid-liquid extractions. It's probably my favourite because the other popular options are chlorinated solvents and I prefer not getting cancer.

When it comes to chromatography, ethyl acetate is king and pet. spirits is its queen: with a mixture of these two solvents you can generally manage to separate anything pretty well (not literally anything, but it's very good for most cases). Increasing the proportion of ethyl acetate will make more polar compounds elute quicker and is likely to make everything elute quickly. Increasing the pet. spirits will usually give better spearation but with too much nothing may move off the baseline. Test combinations using TLC, as you always should.

I like using it in work ups because it can evaporate fairly easily via a rotavap, although it can be quite 'sticky' and some may still show up on NMR. Drying while heating under high vacuum should probably work. While we're on the subject of NMRs, no one uses deuterated ethyl acetate: it'd be way too many hydrogens to replace and it has too many peaks.

I do not believe it is a very common reaction solvent. I've never used it myself. It's not particularly bad, but I suppose its low polarity is an issue in some cases. It'd be bad to use it with water because it could hydrolise into acetic acid, especially if something were there to catalyse it. It cannot dissolve salts, and you would need water and a phase transfer agent if you were using it with salts, but again I'd be cautious of heating it with water.

Ethyl acetate's main hazard is that it can penetrate the skin and cause irritation or carry other chemicals with it, so please replace your gloves even if it's pure ethyl acetate. It is also very flammable.

Apparently, ethyl acetate dissolves cocaine better than water dissolves salt. I don't know how you would use this information, but there you go.

Have fun; don't do drugs.\
