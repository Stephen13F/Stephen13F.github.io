Weighing out reagents for a reaction is such a simple skill but there are ways to improve how you do it and a lot of tricks that are useful that you may not have thought of.

<h1>Weighing Vessel</h1>

This is what you're putting the stuff in. The two basic options are weighing paper and weighing boats. I prefer weighing paper since it's easier to adjust. You should fold the square of weighing paper in half so that you get a triangle (i.e. diagonally so that the corners touch). This will create a little spout and it will let the solid slide nicely into your flask. After doing this, make two folds on either side of the spout. This will create walls that will prevent the solid from falling out as you pour. When making very small squares for tiny amounts of solid, you can cut little curves into these 'walls' towards the spout end. I'm going to be honest and say I never bother doing this and don't really see the point, but it's meant to make something better.

In the absence of weighing paper, magazine paper should do the trick.

Weighing boats I tend to use only if I need to transport the solid back to my bench/hood (e.g. for NBS so I can add it in slowly) or if I am weighing a large mass and the paper would overflow. Weighing boats have built-in walls that are more rigid, which makes it easier to hold things, but it's harder to get everything to slide out neatly because there's no spout.

Sometimes the situation requires a different weighing vessel. By this I mean a flask or a vial.

Vials are best for weighing product so you don't lose any from weighing and transporting back and forth. This way you can weigh your solid into the vial, put it under high vac and then re-weigh it afterwards. Place your vial on the balance, tare the balance, remove the vial and write the mass down (the negative mass will show on the screen) on the vial itself. The weight of the marker should be negligible. Weigh without the vial cap because if you lose the cap your tare will not change. I don't like labelling my vials with stickers (sorry Wallace) so that I can easily check how much product I have left by weighing them.

Weighing a flask is much less accurate due to the size/mass of it, but it is useful if your compound is a liquid, stuck to the side of the flask and hard to remove or just to do a quick check. You should tare your flasks like with vials, but writing the number in greylead on the inside of the neck. Wipe any excess graphite off with a paper towel. This number should be checked regularly as it will vary over time.

<h1>Weighing Volumes</h1>

It is more accurate to determine the mass of a liquid and calculate its volume from its density than to by using a volumetric flask. You can even weigh the solute into the vial and add the solvent into that same vial. In doing so, you avoid any loss of solute that could happen when transferring to a volumetric flask. The issue would be with very dilute solutions because you would need a very large vial or a very small amount of solute, which could make it difficult to weigh it out accurately.

This technique also works quite well for measuring liquid reagents. You can weigh them into a vial or something and then rinse that vial into the reaction vessel with the solvent. Just get a pipette and drop it in, adding it slower as you approach the desired mass. Alternatively, you can tare the reaction vessel and add the liquid reagent to that, but try to do it before adding any other reagents in case you add too much and need to take it back out. If the reagent is dangerous (toxic, air sensitive, or even just stinks), then I would not do this since you should not be taking those things out of a fumehood.

The purpose of this is not so much to get to the desired volume, but to accurately know the volume (which should still hopefully be close enough to the desired volume) which you did add. For this to be accurate, though, you need the density to be for the correct temperature. If the different densities give volumes that do not differ up to the number of figures you are reporting, then this is not really that big a deal, but it will put a limit on your accuracy if you don't know the temperature of the room (always have a thermometer on hand in the lab).

<h1>Weighing Balance Etiquette</h1>

Please keep the balance and surrounding area clean. If you spill anything onto the balance, clean it up with a brush. If more than a few grains of material has fallen, then you should take out the metal plate thing (there may be a few pieces) and clean it off properly, wiping it down with a paper towel and an appropriate solvent (probably give it a final clean with acetone so it dries off better). After doing this, the balance should be recalibrated. The method for this depends on the model of the balance.

The balance should be calibrated regularly. The errors caused by not calibrating it are probably bearable if you weigh large enough masses, but if the mass weighed is very small then you really should calibrate it often. Even just doing it before weighing a very small mass (~30 mg or less) would be a good idea.

Have fun; keep the balance clean!\
