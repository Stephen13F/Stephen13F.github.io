The most important thing a chemist can do, and probably the bare minimum for reliable experiments, is have clean glassware. Trace impurities (especially metal catalysts) can impact reactions significantly. It is also good for lab harmony if you keep things clean. Nothing is worse than reaching for an rbf only to find it still slightly dirty and having to wash it all over again because you don't know how clean it is.

<h1>Glassware</h1>
Acetone, soap, tapwater, distilled water, acetone.

<h1>Glass Frits/h1>

<h1>NMR Tubes</h1>

<h1>Spatulas and Tweezers</h1>
I have said before that elbow grease is the best solvent. This is where it is most true. Rinse spatulas with acetone and then scrub with a paper towel to get them clean. You physically pulling off the compound will be very effective. Use a different solvent if acetone doesn't work (but be safe since it'll get on your fingers). If something is staining it still then you can give it a full wash with a sponge.

<h1>Stirrer Bars</h1>
Acetone scrub will usually do, but sometimes metal catalyst will stick or the stirrer bars will get stained. In this case, a soak in acid overnight or for a few days will do the trick. Be careful with acids. Please use normal acid before you try anything crazy like aqua regia (or worse).

<h1>Glass or Quartz Slides</h1>

<h1>Cuvettes</h1>
Kimwipes

<h1>Glass Stoppers and Adapters</h1>
A wipe with acetone will usually suffice, but if product has actually touched it then I would give it the full wash.

<h1>Glass Pipettes</h1>
Rinse out with acetone and blow dry with compressed air. This is best for pipettes that have only touched solvents (if you used chloroform, rinse it out into the waste with a non-acetone solvent like an alcohol before using acetone). You can clean pipettes that have been used for other things but don't waste too muuch time or solvent. You should rinse with either acetone or a known solvent that dissolves your compound well followed by acetone (or methanol then acetone if the solvent is chlorinated).

<h1>Columns and Plugs</h1>
Silica can often be reused if you have fully washed out everything, there's nothing stuck on the baseline at the top and there's nothing stuck to the frit at the bottom. You may need to recompact it, but that's not too big a deal.

Have fun; keep clean.\
