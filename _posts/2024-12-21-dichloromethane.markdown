I hate DCM. It's personal. I have a phobia of DCM squeeze bottles on account of being sprayed with DCM more often than I would like (and I would like that to be zero times). DCM is very volatile and so requires care when using in a squeeze bottle because it will quite easily shoot out. If I see someone reach for the DCM, I jump a metre away as fast as I can. Please, hold these bottles by the lid or spout, not by the body.

The key thing in DCM's favour, for all of its purposes, is that it is the most polar and readily available solvent that elutes easily, evaporates quickly and is immiscible with water. For reactions, it's also easy to dry, decently unreactive and will not freeze at low temperatures. Being fairly polar it is the solvent I would consider if I need to dissolve very polar compounds for water-free reactions.

DCM is fairly low-polar, but more polar than most common non-hydrogen bond donating solvents. It is a strong solvents, but as it is very volatile, I wouldn't often use it for a reaction unless it were at low temperatures. For example, triflations (using the highly reactive triflic anhydride) are traditionally done in DCM at sub-zero temperatures.

Being water immiscible, DCM is one of the main choices for a liquid-liquid extraction. Like with chloroform, it is more dense than water and so the organic phase will be the bottom layer in your sep funnel. An interesting result of DCM's volatility, is that it seems to cause ice to form on the taps of sep funnels as it evaporates. At least, I think it's ice. I'm too afraid of DCM to test it out for sure. I'm pretty sure it's water vapour in the air cooling down and then freezing. This usually never causes problems except eventually the ice can grow so large it kind of covers the whole tap. Just wipe it off with a paper towel; it's water so it'll just melt (again, I am not sure it is water, but be that as it may, it's never caused issues to me so I'm just telling you this so you don't think something crazy is going on).

DCM is a decently popular chromatography solvent in our lab. You can mix in small amounts of methanol to improve elution of polar compounds. I have, however, heard methanol/DCM mixtures can cause 'shedding' of fragments of silica. I have used methanol/DCM mixtures for chromatography (0-10% methanol in DCM) and never noticed any significant issues.

DCM is carcinogenic. Your gloves will not protect you from it. Please remove them straight away if they get wet. I have also heard it is bad to wash it off with warm water and you should instead use cold water. Handwashing taps in most labs run warm water, so if it's serious, perhaps it'd be better to use the lab sinks. Please check with a legitimate source for this info though.

Have fun; don't â€” HEY! WAIT! STOP! (Gets sprayed with DCM _again_)\
