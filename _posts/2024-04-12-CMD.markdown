Being able to form a C-C bond in the place where a H-C bond was is a very appealing idea for an organic chemist. Generally, C-C bond forming reactions involve 'activation' first: that is, you have to add something to the site you want a reaction to occur at in order for the reaction to occur there. This has its pros and cons, but the main issue is it takes time. Adding an extra step to a reaction means more losses and more work, resources, effort etc etc. So reactions have been found that do without this activation step.

Concerted Metalation-deprotonation (CMD), also known as internal electrophilic substitution (IES) or ambiphilic metal­-ligand activation (AMLA), is one such reaction. It typically combines an aryl halide (e.g. bromobenzene) with another arene to get a biaryl compound, but there are other C bonds it can form. It uses a base and a transition metal catalyst (usually Pd<sup>2+</sup>, Rh<sup>2+</sup>, Ru<sup>3+</sup> or Ir<sup>3+</sup>, but I'll focus on palladium), among other additives, and requires the presence of a carboxylate or a carbonate.

The mechanism, as the name suggests, involves a deprotonation (removal of H<sup>+</sup>) and metallation (formation of a metal-organic bond) that occur at the same time. It was first proposed by Winstein and Traylor in 1955 for the acetolysis of diphenylmercury(II) in acetic acid.

The reaction has been improved and studied in much more depth since then. A prominent figure in the field was Keith Fagnou, but he unexpectedly died in 2009 from the flu at the age of 38. He wrote a lot of reviews and papers on the topic before he died though. His work is a good place to start if you want to read more.

The conditions for this reaction can vary a fair bit, but there are a few common reagents. Firstly, the palladium source is typically Pd(OAc)<sub>2</sub>. The base is usually a carbonate or carboxylate. You might be noticing a theme here: the carbonate/carboxylate is useful because it both facilitates solvolysis of the reaction intermediates (since it has a larger effective volume than, say, Cl<sup>-</sup>) and it can make the palladium more electrophillic (since it can reversibly alternate from being a bidentate to a monodentate ligand). It can also act as an intramolecular base for the deprotonation step. Other bases (amines, hydroxides) lead to just dehalogenation of the aryl halide. The palladium has other ligands, usually phosphines like PCy<sub>3</sub>, SPhos, DavePhos etc.

Other additives include pivalic acid, which is a bulky carboxylic acid, or pivalate, its conjugate base. This acts as a 'proton shuttle' from the arene to the carbonate base. Pivalic acid is also often used as a solvent or cosolvent in some reactions. Even when not the solvent, its used in quite large amounts (e.g. 30 mol%). ANother additive is a silver(I) salt such as AgOAc, AgF or AgOTFA. These are used as an oxidant to help regenerate Pd(II). If an aryl iodide is used, then they can also act as an iodide scavenger since the iodide can poison the catalyst.

The catalytic cycle involves the oxidative addition of the aryl halide then ligand exchange where the halide is replaced by the carbonate base. The next step is the formation of a six-membered transition state with the other arene. An agostic (that means a three-centred two electron bond between a H, a metal and a C) interaction occurs leading up to this which makes the barrier for the deprotonation very low. The deprotonation occurs in the six-membered transition state and the Pd-C bond forms with the second arene. The now protonated carbonate leaves and then you have reductive elimination of the new biaryl and reformation of the catalyst.

The key part of the mechanism is the formation of the transition state: this involves the Pd complex and the arene distorting, which leads to an energy cost (ΔE<sub>dist</sub>), which can be counterd by the energy of interaction (ΔE<sub>int</sub>) which reduces the activation energy needed to reach the transition state. A consequence of this is that the balance between the two will decide which site is most reactive and the relative reactivity of arenes. Electron rich arenes have large (negative) ΔE<sub>int</sub> but also have larger (positive) ΔE<sub>dist</sub>. Conversely, Electron poor arenes have smaller ΔE<sub>int</sub> but also small ΔE<sub>dist</sub>. Thus, it is possible to get a reaction occuring regardless of the electron richness/poverty of the arene.

There are three classes of arenes: one has the selectivity decided by the distortion energies (e.g. benzothiophene, arylfluorides, anisole), the second has the interaction energy as the main deciding factor (e.g. furan), while the third has the best of both worlds (e.g. thiophene) or has neither energy being favourable (e.g. benzene).

 I do not think there is an intuitive way to determine reactivity. All the examples that I've seen showing why one site is preferred used DFT to work it out. I need to think about it a bit more to be sure though.

And now, here are a few interesting papers which use this reaction, along with a few reviews that I used to help write this.

Have fun; don't die.\
