This is a list of places you can buy chemicals from and some notes about each. I've arranged them roughly in order of how likely I am to use them.

IMPORTANT: before buying, please check if prices are in American or Australian dollars. There is a big difference, so don't make the mistake of thinking you have gotten a great deal when in fact it's only a saving of a few dollars. Quality matters more than cost, so don't go with cheaper stuff unless the savings are significant.

<h1>Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)</h1>
Country: America (some stock arrives from Australia)

I generally go to Sigma-Aldrich first and they are probably the main supplier I will go with simply becasue I trust them to deliver me good material on time. Because they have operations here in Australia (in Truganina, Victoria), anything that ships from their Australian supplies will be pretty quick. Less common chemicals will take a while to arrive (I waited ages for deuterated pyridine from them). They are, however not very cheap. I blame this on inflation and monopolisation. Sigma-Aldrich is now owned by the Merck Group, so for all intents and purposes, they're the same company. Merck also sells other useful items (e.g. nylon filter paper, chromatographic silica, TLC plates) and I would generally stick with them for these things.

<h1>AK Scientific</h1>
Country: America

The opposite of Sigma-Aldrich. Many a time I have been tempted by the low, low prices at AK Scientific and have sat around waiting months for the chemical to arrive. I have never really had a problem with the quality of their materials, but they do look distinctly less well-packaged than other suppliers and I would advise you test their products before use. They are _very_ cheap relative to Sigma-Aldrich and have a range comparable to them. I doubt you will find a better price elsewhere, but it does make you wonder how they get it to be so cheap...

AK Sci's website lists their stock in USD, not AUD. It took me longer to realise this than I would like to admit. This accounts for part of why they seem so cheap.

<h1>Chem-Supply</h1>
Country: Australia

Chem-Supply is where we get most of our solvents and other bulk chemicals like acids or salts. I rarely order from them directly since the Uni Melb Specialist Stores has a stock of their items which I buy through them. It is unlikely you will need anything from them that the Store doesn't stock and their range doesn't really extend to anything fancy. Even so, being Australian makes them an appealing choice for delivery times and their prices aren't too bad.

<h1>Strem</h1>
Country: America

Strem is where I will buy my Pd<sub>2</sub>dba<sub>3</sub>. I don't really use it for anything else because I don't use many metal catalysts, but metals are their specialty. They aren't very cheap, but then again, palladium isn't cheap so what do you expect?

<h1>Boron Molecular</h1>
Country: America

I would choose these guys for most boron-containing compounds (boronic acids, diboron species, boranes etc). They offer reliable quality. They do sell a range of materials useful for making conjugated molecules (e.g. fluorenes), which I like, but not a whole lot else.

<h1>TCI</h1>
Country: Japan, America

The Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. They are a reliable company with a good range of products. They operate out of both Japan and American, but I'm not sure if this improves delivery times to Australia or not. I haven't ordered from them but we've got a lot of chemicals in the inventory that came from them.

<h1>Apollo Scientific</h1>
Country: Britain

I have ordered from this company before because it was the cheapest non-AK Scientific supplier for a certain chemical I wanted. I have nothing bad to report from that experience.

<h1>Matrix Scientific</h1>
Country: America

I haven't ordered from them but we've gotten chemicals from them in the past. I don't really have nything to say about them but they seem trustworthy.

<h1>Ambeed</h1>
Country: America

We don't have very many chemicals from this company, but from what I hear online they're decently cheap and good quality. I also hear good things about their customer service.

Have fun; don't get ripped off.\
